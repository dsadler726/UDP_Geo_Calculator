Project Name: UDP Socket Geometry Calculator

Description:
A UDP client-server program that allows a client to connect to a server that allows connected users to calculate geometrical shapes.
Server supports multiple concurrent client connections, each with independent calculations

Running Program:
- From a terminal, run the Makefile to create the client and server
- Within the client and server conf files set the respected IP and port of the server like so
    SERVER_IP= 127.0.1.1
- Run the Server file, passing the server.conf file as a parameter
- Once the Server is running, run the client passing the client.conf as a parameter
- When prompted, say a greeting to the server to establish a connection (HELO 127.0.1.1)
- Once the connection and greeting have been established, send "HELP" for command information
